# Golinks2

I love the [golinks](https://github.com/GoLinks/golinks) project and thought that it's a decent project idea to implement while serving as a playground to learn django and other tech. The desired feature set is:
- ✅  ability to save links
- ✅  redirect to a link. 
- ✅  list the links. 
- search through the available - use webassembly and rust for the search feature. 
- ✅  have ability to specify the paths as aliases : `cs/papers/kafka` etc.
- ✅  list subdirectories (for example, when you do `go/ref`). 
- edit and delete url. 
- ✅  authenticated logins. 
- have the bookmarks associated with each user.
- ✅ heirarchy of bookmarks


## More ideas:
- add logging framework
- sharing the bookmarks or having user groups
- containerize the application
- It can also be extended to have a personal toolkit - `t/` is the toolkit subdomain, wherein the subdomains open in an embedded webview. For example: `t/epoch` takes you to the eopchconverter website in an embedded view. Hence, a "toolkit"
- beautify the interface
- setup CI/CD (unit tests) only for the repo
- record search result performance (what rank search result is being selected?)
- use webassembly when introducing search
- performance tests

doubts:
- concurrency scenario in django - how are long running tasks handled? Does it block the further API use?
